# RoadTripHelper
As the name suggests, is supposed to be a tool focused on helping to organise and quickly find routes for a road trip.
It should be able to:
  - retrive data from the internet and store it efficiently for later use
  - find the quickes route between multiple points
  - find neares "national park", "walmart" etc.
  - maybe: retrieve weather conditions through the national weather service (US)
